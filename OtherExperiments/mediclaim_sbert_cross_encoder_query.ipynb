      "LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION\n",
      "Our analysis was limited to observational evidence with varied reporting, high heterogeneity and risk of bias across included studies, which may limit the generalizability and confidence in our findings.||There is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines are associated with an increased risk of miscarriage.||\n",

      "According to the results, the most commonly shared vaccine misinformation was that COVID-19 vaccines contain a microchip to track people.||None of the approved COVID-19 vaccines contain the live virus that causes COVID-19.||Another claim falsely asserts that COVID-19 vaccines serve as a device to insert microchips for purposes of tracking or surveillance, sometimes led by software and computer developers.||\n",
      "However, by mid-summer 2020, 20 states had issued mask mandates, many of which required that individuals wear a mask or face covering whenever they were indoors or outside and unable to distance themselves from others [\n",
      "As COVID-19 vaccination levels increased, the federal government began to relax their stance on masks and social distancing for those who were fully vaccinated [\n",
      "].||Nonetheless, by the end of July 2021, the CDC recommended that vaccinated individuals wear their masks if they lived in COVID-19 hotspots after an increase of cases caused by the delta variant [\n",

      "Individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 and remain unvaccinated should be encouraged to complete vaccinations, as they are eligible, to reduce their risk of reinfection.||There is concern that the available COVID-19 vaccines may not provide sufficient immunity against new variants.||On the other hand, COVID-19 vaccination is not recommended for children less than 12 years of age.||\n",

      "While these types of misinformation emerged during the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic and they are still pervasive, additional rumors and conspiracy theories have emerged about COVID-19 vaccines in particular as governments and scientists invested heavily in capitalizing on existing messenger RNA (mRNA) technology to quickly develop new COVID-19 vaccines.||First, was the vaccine developed too quickly?||The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was the first mRNA-based vaccine introduced to boost immunity against COVID-19; however, it could lead to various adverse reactions.||\n",
