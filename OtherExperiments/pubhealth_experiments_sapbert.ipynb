      "Score: 131.43165588378906, Document: Congress had both good practical reason and Constitutional authority to enact PLCAA.\n",
      " Its purpose and effect was to call a halt to the campaign (backed by the administration of Bill Clinton, Hillary’s husband) to launch financially ruinous litigation against firearms makers and dealers — most of them thinly capitalized firms unable to withstand massive legal bills — and apply the resulting leverage to extract promises of gun control without the bother of seeking approval for those measures from a then‐​skeptical U.S. Congress.\n",
      " It was a campaign rightly decried as undemocratic even by such figures of the Left as former cabinet secretary Robert Reich.\n",
      " It was also a travesty of legal ethics, employing litigation as a pure weapon; thus then‐​HUD secretary Andrew Cuomo warned gunmakers that unless they cooperated they’d suffer “death by a thousand cuts”, while then‐​New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer reportedly warned Glock: “If you do not sign, your bankruptcy lawyers will be knocking at your door.”   It is not the place of the U.S. Congress to rectify every ill of litigation that may arise in state courts, but the Constitution specifically contemplates that federal lawmakers will oversee the doings of state courts when those courts assert power over transactions and residents of other states.\n",
      " Thus Article IV, Section 1 grants Congress the power “by general Laws [to] prescribe the …Effect” of state law in other states.\n",
      " These powers are peculiarly relevant when employed to safeguard a Constitutionally specified right that is (purposely) put in jeopardy by tactical abuse of interstate lawsuits.\n",
      " Despite the claims of some opponents, Congress’s formula for resolving litigation amounted in essence to restoring, not overturning, the traditional common‐​law bounds of gun liability.\n",
      " It left open a few exceptions for instances where liability might have been found with some warrant in the older common law, as when a gun explodes or is knowingly sold to a person intent on harm.\n",
      " Otherwise, it codifies the same common‐​law rule that Cuomo, Clinton et al were hoping to get the courts to abandon: if an otherwise lawful firearm has performed as it was designed and intended to do, its maker and seller are not liable for its misuse.\n",

      " But tensions erupted between Meadows and the two witnesses after Moynihan and Doyle refused to turn over 6,000 pages of documents that they say back up their claims — documents that the pair has already given to the FBI and the IRS.\n",
      " “If you’re not going to share [the documents] with the committee and cut to the chase, my patience is running out,” said Meadows.\n",
      " After consulting briefly with their attorney, who was present, Moynihan and Doyle said they still would not turn over their report but would answer questions about it.\n",
      " Moynihan is a private financial investigator whose online biography says he previously worked for the Department of Justice and the Drug Enforcement Agency.\n",
      " Doyle said he went into financial investigation after a career on Wall Street.\n",
      " During their testimony, Moynihan and Doyle said they carried out an extensive forensic investigation of the Clinton Foundation based on public records, tax filings, and private interviews with Clinton Foundation officials.\n",
      " The investigators said Clinton Foundation CFO Andrew Kessel admitted to them in a taped conversation that Bill Clinton used the foundation’s bank accounts for personal expenses.\n",
      " “He told us that Mr. Clinton mixed and matched his personal business with that of the foundation,” said Moynihan.\n",
      " They also said they viewed foundation emails from 2002 discussing deals with the government of Mozambique.\n",
      " Moynihan said this was evidence that the Clinton Foundation was working on behalf of foreign governments even though the foundation’s stated mission in IRS filings at the time was to build Bill Clinton’s presidential library.\n",
      " “The foundation began working as an agent of a foreign government early in its life and continued” to do so, said Moynihan.\n",
      " Moynihan and Doyle said they could not turn over the documents from their investigation to the committee because they did not want to infringe on ongoing investigations at government agencies.\n",
      " They said they hope to make money off their investigation and have turned over the documents to the IRS as part of a “probable cause” submission.\n",
      " The IRS does sometimes pay whistleblowers and tipsters from taxes they recoup in such cases.\n",
      " But Meadows questioned that explanation, saying he spoke to the IRS before the hearing and was told the witnesses’ work with the committee would have no impact on the status of the IRS investigation.\n",
      " “I don’t find how [refusing to turn over information] provides a good foundation for truth and transparency,” said Meadows.\n",
      " Republican Rep. Jody Hice also criticized the witnesses.\n",
      " “I feel like you’re using us for your own benefit,” said Hice, adding that there was a “little game going on here.”  Moynihan argued that he and Doyle were invited to the hearing and would have happily not attended.\n",
      " “Let me be very clear.\n",
      " You invited us.\n",
      " If you don’t want us, disinvite us,” he said.\n",
      " Moynihan added that there was no benefit to sharing the documents with the committee because congress doesn’t have law enforcement capabilities.\n",
      " “That’s why we presented to government agencies, which you’re not,” said Moynihan.\n",
      " Meadows promised to subpoena the documents from his witnesses.\n",
      " “Don’t get cute with me,” he told Moynihan.\n",
      " “I thought you said you were all about the rule of law, all about the truth.”  Thursday’s hearing will be the last one led this year by Meadows, who will hand over the chairman’s gavel to the incoming House Democratic majority at the beginning of 2019.\n",
      " Meadows said the hearing was necessary in light of news that the foundation’s donations plummeted by 58 percent after Hillary Clinton lost the election.\n",
      " The drop in contributions \"could suggest pay to play activity in the years prior to the decrease in donations,\" said Meadows.\n",
      " Meadows also expressed disappointment that the Department of Justice declined to send U.S. Attorney John Huber, who is reportedly investigating the foundation, to testify on Thursday.\n",
      " Rep. Gerry Connolly, the ranking Democrat on the committee, objected to the hearing as a rehash of \"conspiracy theories.\"\n",

      " But late Thursday, a spokesman for Assembly Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald (R-Horicon) said if Senate Democrats have not returned to Madison by Friday, the Assembly might act first.Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca (D-Kenosha) said Assembly Democrats were focused on drafting amendments to the bill.\n",
      " He left open the possibility that Assembly Democrats would leave town like the Senate Democrats to prevent the Assembly from acting.But that scenario appears unlikely.\n",
      " To pass a budget bill in that house, 58 members of the Assembly must be present.\n",
      " There are 57 Republicans in the Assembly, and Rep. Bob Ziegelbauer (I-Manitowoc) said he plans to vote for the bill.Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald (R-Juneau) said that Democrats in his house were \"not showing up for work\" and that he wanted law enforcement to bring them back.\n",
      " \"That's not democracy.\n",
      " That's not what this chamber is about,\" Fitzgerald said of the boycott.Coggs disputed that.\n",
      " \"We're doing our job of making sure the people have an opportunity to have their voices heard,\" he said.The state constitution says lawmakers can be compelled to attend floor sessions.\n",
      " Senate Chief Clerk Rob Marchant said he was \"researching the extent to which law enforcement can be involved\" in doing that.Sen.\n",
      " Tim Cullen (D-Janesville) first confirmed Thursday morning that Democrats were boycotting the Senate action on the bill in efforts to block a quorum and keep the measure from passing.\n",
      " Because 20 senators of the 33-member house must be present to pass a fiscal bill, the body's 19 Republicans are not enough to pass the budget repair bill.Cullen said Democrats hope delaying the bill will give more time for union demonstrators to win over any possible wavering Republicans or force Walker to negotiate.\n",
      " Walker has said he hopes to finish the bill by Feb. 25 for an offering of state bonds that would be affected by the budget-repair bill.The Rockford Register Star reported that Democratic senators arrived at the Clock Tower at about 10:30 a.m. and left later in the day.\n",
      " State Sen. Jim Holperin (D-Conover) told the Illinois newspaper that Democrats wanted more time to understand the bill and debate its impacts.\n",
      " \"This is pretty significant legislation that would take away decades of collective bargaining rights,\" Holperin said.Scott Fitzgerald said he believed the last time such an action happened was in October 1995.\n",
      " At that time, then-Sen. Joe Wineke (D-Verona) fled the Senate to block passage of the $250 million Miller Park stadium deal that raised the sales tax in the Milwaukee area.The Senate Democrats' tactic didn't win over Sen.\n",
      " Rob Cowles (R-Green Bay), a moderate whom unions had been trying to persuade to vote against the bill.\n",
      " Cowles called the blockage of the Senate vote an attempt to \"shut down democracy.\n",
      " \"Lack of quorumThe Senate convened at 11:30 a.m., with 17 Republicans but no Democrats present.\n",
      " After a prayer and the Pledge of Allegiance, action immediately was disrupted by demonstrators in the gallery shouting, \"Freedom, democracy, unions.\"\n",
      " One of the two missing Republicans arrived shortly afterward and an aide to the 19th, Sen. Dale Schultz (R-Richland Center), said his boss was unable to make it to the Senate through the demonstrators.Senate President Mike Ellis (R-Neenah) made a call of the house to bring the additional senators needed to vote on the bill to the Senate floor.Walker and Scott Fitzgerald have said they were confident that the GOP lawmakers had the votes they needed to pass the bill without further changes.\n",
      " Walker said Thursday that the proposal's cuts to worker benefits and union bargaining laws are financially necessary and that he wouldn't accept changes that compromised the saving he's seeking.The state has a $137 million budget shortfall for the fiscal year ending June 30 and a more than $3 billion shortfall over the next two years.\n",
      " The cuts to benefits would save taxpayers nearly $330 million through mid-2013.Republicans control the Senate, 19-14, meaning they can lose only two votes and still pass the bill if all Democrats oppose it.\n",
      " Some Republicans have shown reluctance about the bill, though so far none have said publicly that they will vote against it.Sen.\n",
      " Luther Olsen (R-Ripon) said he was uncomfortable about the bill's effects on workers but also concerned about the other alternatives to fix the budget.\n",
      " \"I will probably vote for it\" on the Senate floor, Olsen said.Top GOP leaders in the Legislature have said they expect the bill to pass both houses with the changes adopted by the Joint Finance Committee late Wednesday on a party-line vote.\n",
      " Some GOP senators attempted to make changes to the bill Wednesday that would go further than the Joint Finance Committee changes but had no success.The biggest change approved by the Joint Finance Committee would require local governments that don't have a civil-service system to create one to address grievances for employee termination, employee discipline and workplace safety.The committee left major elements of the bill in place.\n",
      " It would require most public workers to pay half their pension costs - typically 5.8% of pay for state workers - and at least 12% of their health care costs.\n",
      " It applies to most state and local employees but does not apply to police, firefighters and state troopers, who would continue to bargain for their benefits.Except for police, firefighters and troopers, raises would be limited to inflation unless a bigger increase was approved in a referendum.\n",
      " The non-law enforcement unions would lose their rights to bargain over anything but wages, would have to hold annual elections to keep their organizations intact and would lose the ability to have union dues deducted from state paychecks.Don Walker and Lee Bergquist of the Journal Sentinel staff contributed to this report.\n",

      " Close Icon                     Business  Some Americans Depend on Their Tax Refunds to Survive  The survey reveals that a majority of Americans plan to use their refunds to pay off debt or cover basic necessities.\n",
      " Janie Boschma  National Journal       March 16, 2015                        Link Copied           Americans are generally feeling more optimistic about the economy and their own financial situations, but many are relying on savings from this year's tax refunds and low gas prices to cover basic necessities and pay off debt.\n",
      " These findings from the latest Allstate/National Journal Heartland Monitor Poll and follow-up interviews with respondents reflect the fact that while some segments of the population have largely recovered after the recession, many are still struggling to cover their expenses and dig out from under years of debt—and see the savings as a welcome financial cushion.\n",
      " More than half of respondents said they expect to receive a tax refund this year.\n",
      " Of those, 82 percent said lower fuel prices have made a difference in improving their financial situations.\n",
      " Thirty-seven percent of those expecting a tax refund said they plan to use it to pay off debt, 29 percent would save or invest it, and 20 percent said the money would go toward covering basic necessities.\n",
      " Less than 10 percent said they'd spend the extra money on something nice or fun.\n",
      " Decisions on how to spend that tax refund revealed stark contrasts across race, income, and education levels.\n",
      " While each demographic prioritized paying off debt, only 36 percent of whites said they would use their refund to pay bills compared to 47 percent of black respondents and 43 percent of Hispanics.\n",
      " Whites were the most likely to save or invest their refund—30 percent reported those plans, nearly 10 percentage points higher than black and Hispanic adults.\n",
      " College-educated millennials, many still shouldering long-term student loan debt, were the most likely to expect a tax refund (74 percent).\n",
      " About 40 percent said they plan to put their refund toward paying off loans, about the same share who would pay off debt among those without a college degree between the ages of 18 and 64.\n",
      " Bailey Price, a college graduate from Lincoln, Neb., used her tax refund to whittle down her outstanding student loan debt, which she expects to pay off within the next two to three years.\n",
      " Beyond debt, her tax return allows her family a bit more freedom in their budget.\n",
      " \"It's given us a little more wiggle room for certain things that pop up like a friend's baby shower, so we can actually afford a decent present for that, or recently we've had a couple things go wrong with our car and we were able to pull together funds that we wouldn't have had,\" says Price.\n",
      " \"It just allows us to catch our breath a little bit more.\n",
      " \"The share of adults saving or investing their refund also increased with each income bracket, ranging from 20 percent of those earning $30,000 or less to 40 percent of adults making $100,000 or more annually.\n",
      " Adults with a four-year degree aged 40 and older were most likely to save or invest their refunds and more likely to use their refund to buy something nice or fun (still only about 12 percent).Adults over the age of 40 without a college degree were the most likely group to use their refund to pay for necessities.\n",
      " Barbara Thomas, 58 from Irrigon, Ore., already spent her tax refund on medical bills from a recent surgery to remove cancerous melanoma.\n",
      " Thomas works seasonally in the fishing industry and over the winter, she and her husband have tried to stretch his retirement income to cover both their regular expenses and her doctor's appointments.\n",
      " Anything extra that comes their way--whether her refund or fuel savings--makes all the difference.\n",
      " \"It just makes it a lot easier to make ends meet,\" Thomas said.\n",
      " \"Living on social security is tough.\n",
      " \"About three-quarters of respondents reported saving money from low gas prices recently.\n",
      " Just under one-third said they're using those savings to cover necessities, 27 percent are paying off debt or buying less on credit, and 19 percent are saving or investing the difference.\n",
      " Less than 10 percent said they are either driving more or buying luxury items with their fuel savings.The impact of a lower gas price followed similar patterns along racial, income, and education lines.\n",
      " Minority respondents were more likely to report savings at the pump having a \"huge or significant\" financial impact, with 38 percent and 35 percent of Hispanic and black respondents, respectively, compared to 30 percent of whites.Sean Adams, a 23-year-old African-American who works for the government near Virginia Beach, Virginia, said lower gas prices have made a huge difference for his budget.\n",
      " He's used the savings to pay off bills and buy necessities he put off while the fuel price was so high and filling his tank trumped other expenses.\n",
      " \"You shouldn't be making life decisions at the pump,\" says Adams, \"but you do what you have to do.\n",
      " You have to get to work.\n",
      " \"Parents with school-aged children were more likely to feel the impact of cheaper fuel (62 percent), compared to parents with adult children (50 percent) and non-parents (54 percent).Kimberly McDaniel, a nursing student from Nacogdoches, Texas, says lower gas prices have cut her monthly fuel bill by more than half.\n",
      " She had been spending about $300 monthly to commute to medical school and to pick up her kids at school; now she only spends about $120.A divorced mother of three, McDaniel says she's used her tax refund and fuel savings to help provide for her children, and pay off her mortgage and car payments while she's studying full-time.\n",
      " \"I'm basically having to use that to pay bills and everything to make it through,\" she says.\n",
      " \"There's no extra spending going on right now.\n",
      " In a normal situation if I were still working and not going to school, we would have more money to spend money on other things, like going to the movies or taking them skating.\"\n",

      " — Most Americans, including most gun owners, would support reasonable limits on guns to help stop massacres like the one last week in Oregon, Hillary Clinton told Iowans Tuesday.“I’m tired of people in public life saying, ‘Our thoughts and prayers are with families whose children are murdered at community colleges or elementary schools or people killed at Bible studies or going to the movies,’ ” the Democratic presidential candidate said.\n",
      " “We can’t tolerate that.\n",
      " This doesn’t just happen.\n",
      " … We let it happen.”Her audience at Davenport’s RiverCenter applauded as Clinton vowed to make it harder for people who shouldn’t have guns to obtain them.\n",
      " Among other things, she favors broader background checks, including sales at gun shows, and stronger measures to prevent gun purchases by domestic abusers or people with serious mental health problems.“We keep getting stymied because of the lobby for a very small minority of gun owners and the gun manufacturers, which stand in the way,” she said.Clinton has spoken throughout the campaign about her intention to implement tighter gun rules, despite pressure from the National Rifle Association.\n",
      " This week, she released specifics of her proposals.“I feel like this is unfinished business in our country, and I am very determined that we are going to try to bring some sanity back, so that people’s Second Amendment rights are protected — but they are not absolute, the way the NRA wants them to be.\n",
      " There are common-sense ways to make sure people are not using guns to commit mass murders.”Later Tuesday, speaking outside a bed and breakfast in Muscatine, Clinton alluded to comments former Florida Gov.\n",
      " Jeb Bush made after the Oregon shooting at a community college.\n",
      " “When one of the leading Republican candidates when asked about this, said, ‘Yeah, stuff happens,’ ” Clinton recounted, to groans from her audience.\n",
      " “No.\n",
      " That’s like an admission of fatalism and defeat.\n",
      " That’s not who we are as Americans.”MORE:Download Iowa Caucuses appCandidate trackerFull Iowa Caucus coverageClinton spent much of her time at both events responding to voter questions, ranging from Social Security to ISIS to the economy.\n",
      " In Davenport, she spoke at length about her intention to protect gains from the Affordable Care Act, including insurance coverage for millions more Americans, and to address continuing problems in health care, such as huge price increases for medication.Clinton singled out Iowa’s dominant health-insurer, Wellmark Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield, for criticism.\n",
      " She panned Wellmark’s near monopoly in Iowa, and noted that it recently gained approval for premium increases of 18 percent to 28 percent.\n",
      " “That is a lack of competition,” she said.Wellmark spokeswoman Traci McBee responded in an email to the Register that Wellmark’s rate increases were legitimate.“Rate increases in Iowa are designed to cover the increased cost of care as well as required fees and administration expenses.\n",
      " Nothing more,” McBee wrote.\n",
      " “In fact, the Affordable Care Act protects consumers from unnecessary increases in premiums and prevents health insurance companies from using rates to make up for past losses or excessive profits.\n",
      " In essence, the ACA, by definition, does not allow health insurers to make too much money.\n",
      " If health insurers overprice policies and does not pay out enough in health care claims, they are required to rebate money back to members.”AT THE EVENTSETTING: The RiverCenter in Davenport.CROWD: About 400, according to the Clinton campaign.REACTION: The event mainly focused on voter questions.\n",
      " Audience members applauded a range of Clinton's answers, including on gun issues and Social Security.\n",
      " They laughed when a voter asked the candidate what she intended to do with her husband, former President Bill Clinton, when she returns to the White House.\n",

      " May cut off funding if not open!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 8, 2020Trump began by stating that in “Germany, Denmark, Norway, [and] Sweden,” “SCHOOLS ARE OPEN WITH NO PROBLEMS.” Trump contended Democrats sought to keep schools closed for unspecified political reasons, mentioning the November 2020 election.In response, Klaas claimed that the following statistics represented new diagnosed cases of COVID-19 in the same countries versus the United States on July 7 2020:New cases, yesterday [July 7 2020]:Germany: 298 Denmark: 10 Norway: 11 Sweden: 57United States: 55,442Source of Figures New COVID-19 Cases on July 7 2020Klaas didn’t provide a source for his numbers, but they were relatively easy to find on Worldometers.info.We first noticed that the page itself had been archived repeatedly on the Wayback Machine, and that archives of the site’s pages did not consistently display figures as they appeared on the dates.As of July 9 2020, the site’s figures were available under a tab “2 days ago.” The exact figure in Klass’ tweet was visible for the United States (which, when sorted by volume, was in the first spot):Germany and Sweden were side by side, numbering 49 and 50 respectively.\n",
      " Although the tweet’s count for Germany matched Worldometers.info’s data, Sweden’s numbers were off, with 295 new cases — not 57:Norway and Denmark were similarly nearly adjacent, at numbers 114 and 116 on the list sorted by case count.\n",
      " Norway was listed at eleven new cases, and Denmark, ten:In that respect, the tweet correctly transposed four of the five countries listed — the United States, Germany, Norway, and Denmark.\n",
      " However, according to the same source, Sweden was listed as having 295 new cases on July 7 2020 — not 57.We located a number of articles from sources in the United States reiterating the figure of 55,442 new cases on July 7 2020, but all in turn cited Worldometers.info as their source.Is Worldometers.info a Reliable Source for COVID-19 Case Counts and Deaths?Worldometers.info seemed to emerge from the ether at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and as we noted above, had been archived repeatedly as COVID-19 developed into a global pandemic.The Wayback Machine indicates that the site had no archived pages at any point before late January 2020:On May 19 2020, CNN published an in-depth look into whether Worldometers.info’s reliability matched its new global prominence as a source for to-the-minute information about the COVID-19 pandemic.The outlet’s findings were mixed.\n",
      " Citing traffic metrics site BuzzSumo, CNN described a meteoric rise for the newly popular site — finding that in the previous “six months, its pages [had] been shared about 2.5 million times — up from just 65 shares in the first six months of 2019.” CNN noted that for all the credence given Worldometers.info in the news and on social media, little was known about the scope or credibility of its data:The website claims to be “run by an international team of developers, researchers, and volunteers” and “published by a small and independent digital media company based in the United States.”But public records show little evidence of a company that employs a multilingual team of analysts and researchers.\n",
      " It’s not clear whether the company has paid staff vetting its data for accuracy or whether it relies solely on automation and crowdsourcing.\n",
      " The site does have at least one job posting, from October, seeking a volunteer web developer.The network also examined the site’s source code, unearthing a cluster of related sites with myriad purposes.\n",
      " Often, the sites revolved around “live stats” counting:IDs in the source code for Worldometer and the US Dadax’s websites link them to at least two dozen other websites that appear to share ownership.\n",
      " Some appear to be defunct.\n",
      " Others, such as usalivestats.com, italiaora.org and stopthehunger.com, share the same premise: live stats counters.\n",
      " Most of the sites have a rudimentary aesthetic, reminiscent of a 1990s or early 2000s internet.\n",
      " Some seem quite random.\n",
      " One Italian site displays Christmas poems and gift suggestions, like a bonsai plant (for her), or a plot of land on the moon (for him).\n",
      " Another site is dedicated to Sicilian puppet shows.Attempts to verify the validity of the wide-ranging, multinational information hosted on the site each day were similarly unsteady and nebulous.\n",
      " One Wikipedia editor cited specific errors, and further observed that the data appeared to be biased in favor of larger figures:According to Worldometer’s website, its Covid-19 data comes from a multilingual team that “monitors press briefings’ live streams throughout the day” and through crowdsourcing.Visitors can report new Covid-19 numbers and data sources to the website – no name or email address required.\n",
      " A “team of analysts and researchers” validate the data, the website says.\n",
      " It may, at first, sound like the Wikipedia of the data world, but some Wikipedia editors have decided to avoid Worldometer as a source for Covid-19 data.“Several updates lack a source, do not match their cited source or contain errors,” one editor, posting under the username MarioGom, wrote on a discussion page for Wikipedia editors working on Covid-19-related content last month.\n",
      " “Some errors are small and temporary, but some are relatively big and never corrected.”The editor, whose real name is Mario Gómez, told CNN in an email, “Instead of trying to use a consistent criteria, [Worldometer] seems to be going for the highest figure.\n",
      " They have a system for users to report higher figures, but so far I failed to use it to report that some figure is erroneous and should be lower.”Edouard Mathieu, the data manager for Our World in Data (OWID), an independent statistics website headquartered at Oxford University, has seen a similar trend.“Their main focus seems to be having the latest number wherever it comes from, whether it’s reliable or not, whether it’s well-sourced or not,” he said.\n",
      " “We think people should be wary, especially media, policy-makers and decision-makers.\n",
      " This data is not as accurate as they think it is.”A FAQ page on the site itself reflected that ambiguity.\n",
      " Worldometers.info seemed to indicate at least some of its information was crowdsourced, before pivoting to a portfolio of outlets which had referenced its data:Official reports, directly from Government’s communication channels or indirectly, through local media sources when deemed reliable.\n",
      " We provide the source of each data update in the “Latest Updates” (News) section.\n",
      " Timely updates are made possible thanks to the participation of users around the world and to the dedication of a team of analysts and researchers who validate data from an ever-growing list of over 5,000 sources.\n",

      "Score: 173.59906005859375, Document: readSAN FRANCISCO—Chris Nowinski didn’t intend to talk to the press; he just dropped by to hear what the National Football League had to say these days about brain injuries, about concussions, about the neurological disease known as CTE.\n",
      " Nowinski is the co-founder and executive director of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, the leading concussion advocacy organization in America.\n",
      " He just wanted to listen.\n",
      " He was astonished.“I sort of feel like I’m re-living big tobacco in real time,” said Nowinski, after watching an NFL-affiliated doctor refuse to speak about the connection between football and CTE, or chronic traumatic encephalopathy.\n",
      " The NFL had just held its annual health and safety press conference.\n",
      " Reported concussions were up 58 per cent this season, but the event was mostly devoted to the winners of the technological innovation contest the NFL set up with GE.\n",
      " Winners included makers of a turf underpad, safer helmets — ah, that old chestnut — and brainwave or blood scans to detect concussions.And then Dr. Mitch Berger, a member of the NFL’s Head, Neck &amp; Spine Committee, resolutely refused to admit there was a link between CTE and football.\n",
      " Boston University had found CTE in 90 of 94 examined brains of NFL players; this week, legendary quarterbacks Kenny Stabler and Earl Morrall were added to the list.\n",
      " I asked Dr. Berger, a professor and the chairman of the University of California, San Francisco’s Neurological Surgery Department, where he was on a link between football and CTE.“There’s no question that there are degenerative disorders of the brain that occur after a car accident, we can see it after gunshot wounds to the brain,” said Dr. Berger.\n",
      " “And the interesting thing about the literature as it’s evolved over the years is you can see tau deposits in the brain in individuals who have never had a traumatic brain injury .\n",
      " .\n",
      " .\n",
      " we’re obviously very concerned about this.\n",
      " So if we’re going to find a link in football, we also have to find a link in the military population, in the civilian population, to put this whole story together.”Asked again about football, Dr. Berger again obfuscated.\n",
      " “There’s no question that you can find degenerative changes that are indicative of CTE in individuals who have played football .\n",
      " .\n",
      " .\n",
      " (but) I think tau is found in brains that have traumatic injuries.\n",
      " Whether it’s from football, whether it’s from car accidents, gunshot wounds, domestic violence, remains to be seen.”But, football.“Well, again, we’ve seen evidence anecdotally of a number of players who have come to autopsy who have had the diagnosis made.\n",
      " We’ve also seen a number of players who have done very well.\n",
      " “What he was saying, that’s 10 years ago talk.\n",
      " I can’t believe Dr. Berger wasn’t up to speed on the research, and that’s why it’s so intentionally misleading.”Nowinski cited the league’s recent withdrawal of a $16 million (U.S.) grant as part of a $30 million pledge to fund brain studies after it went to Dr. Robert Stern of Boston University, who has done extensive research on the brains of NFL players, and has criticized the league.\n",
      " The National Institutes of Health stepped forward to replace the lost funding.“It was frankly a slap in the face to every family suffering from CTE right now,” said Nowinski, with some agitation in his voice.\n",
      " “That study was delayed by at least nine months by the games the NFL was trying to play .\n",
      " .\n",
      " .\n",
      " I thought the (NFL’s good-faith move) was the $30 million to NIH.\n",
      " But I was proven wrong.\n",
      " They lied when they said it was no-strings attached, they lied when they said they would fund the BU study.\n",
      " And the lies have finally convinced me that only lies are going to follow.“Personally, I’m happy that it’s not going to be NFL money funding this study.\n",
      " But for me, personally, that was kind of the last straw in the attempt to claim there’s a good-faith effort from the NFL.”Nowinski ceded that pending class-action settlement litigation may factor into a refusal to link CTE and football.\n",
      " He also noted that the science indicates it’s the volume of brain trauma that leads to CTE, and thinks the next big step should be limiting youth football until high school age, so as to limit the exposure to repetitive brain trauma.\n",
      " “I am a firm believer that no one should be playing tackle football before high school,” Nowinski said.\n",
      " “One of the problems we have in this country on this debate is the NFL is strongly funding and underwriting youth football in this country, through USA Football, through Heads Up football, through the mom marketing programs, and commissioner Goodell going and teaching tackling to mothers .\n",
